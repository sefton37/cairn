# ReOS (Talking Rock) Project Guide

> **See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the comprehensive workflow (Comprehension → Clarification → Planning → Execution).** This document provides ReOS-specific context only.

---

## What This Is

**Talking Rock** is a local-first AI assistant with three specialized agents:
- **CAIRN** (Priority 1) - Attention minder and life organizer (1B models)
- **ReOS** (Priority 2) - Natural language Linux system control (1-3B models)
- **RIVA** (Frozen) - Code verification engine (7-8B+ models, future work)

**Core philosophy:** Local inference is essentially free, enabling verification and analysis at scale that cloud services can't afford. Zero trust, local only, encrypted at rest, never phones home.

## Architecture Quick Reference

Read these first when working on the project:
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](src/reos/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System overview, data models, component architecture
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Mission statement, agent descriptions, development priorities
- **[CAIRN_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md](docs/CAIRN_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md)** - Recent optimization work

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Atomic Operations (3x2x3 Taxonomy)

Every user request is classified and recorded as an atomic operation:

```python
# Classification dimensions
destination_type: "stream" | "file" | "process"  # Where output goes
consumer_type: "human" | "machine"               # Who consumes result
execution_semantics: "read" | "interpret" | "execute"  # What action

# Examples
"show memory usage"     → (stream, human, read)
"save to notes.txt"     → (file, human, execute)
"run pytest"            → (process, machine, execute)
"what's next today?"    → (stream, human, interpret)
```

**Location:** `src/reos/atomic_ops/` - processor, executor, cairn_integration

#### 2. The Play (2-Tier Life Organization)

```python
Act        # Life narrative (Career, Health, Family) - months to years
  └─ Scene # Calendar event or task within the narrative

SceneStage = "planning" | "in_progress" | "awaiting_data" | "complete"
```

Philosophy: Two levels prevent obscuring responsibility in complexity. Acts answer "What narrative?" Scenes answer "When am I doing this?"

**Location:** `src/reos/play_fs.py`, `src/reos/play_db.py`

#### 3. CAIRN Intent Engine (4-Stage Pipeline)

```
Stage 1: Extract Intent    → Pattern matching → Category (CALENDAR, PLAY, SYSTEM)
Stage 2: Verify Intent     → Check tool availability, build args
Stage 3: Execute Tool      → Call MCP tool with extracted args
Stage 4: Generate Response → Strictly from tool results (no hallucination)
```

**Location:** `src/reos/cairn/intent_engine.py`

#### 4. MCP Tools System

45+ tools organized by category:
- `cairn_*` - The Play CRUD, calendar, contacts, knowledge (CairnToolHandler)
- `linux_*` - System operations (linux_tools.py)
- `reos_*` - Git/repo operations (git_tools.py)

**Location:** `src/reos/mcp_tools.py`, `src/reos/cairn/mcp_tools.py`

## Code Quality Standards

### Python Requirements

```bash
# Python version
python >= 3.12

# Formatting and linting
ruff check .           # Lint (E, F, I, UP, B rules)
ruff format .          # Format (100 char line length)

# Type checking
mypy src/              # Strict equality, warn return any

# Testing
pytest --cov           # Minimum 45% coverage required
```

### Configuration (pyproject.toml)

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py312"
select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP", "B"]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov=reos --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=45"

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
strict_equality = true
```

### Code Conventions

- **Type hints:** Use `|` for unions (e.g., `str | None`), not `Optional[]`
- **Error handling:** Fail loudly with context. Use structured error types in `src/reos/errors.py`
- **Dataclasses:** Prefer dataclasses over dicts for structured data
- **Docstrings:** Required for public functions; explain WHY, not WHAT
- **File organization:** Follow existing structure (`cairn/`, `atomic_ops/`, `providers/`, `rpc_handlers/`)

---

## Recent Design Decisions

### 1. CAIRN Simplification (2026-01)
**Context:** Simple conversational queries were going through 11 processing layers.

**Changes:**
- Intent-aware verification (FAST mode for READ/INTERPRET on STREAM destinations)
- Removed redundant decomposition calls
- Conditional intent enhancement (only when contextual references present)

**Result:** Personal questions now ~6 layers instead of 11, preserving full verification for mutations.

See [CAIRN_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md](docs/CAIRN_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md)

### 2. Ollama-Only Provider Strategy
**Decision:** ReOS uses Ollama exclusively for local inference. No cloud providers.

**Rationale:** Mission alignment (local-first), cost (free after download), privacy (no data leaves machine).

**Implementation:** `src/reos/providers/factory.py` creates Ollama provider only. Anthropic provider removed.

### 3. RIVA Development Frozen
**Decision:** Code agent development paused until CAIRN and ReOS prove small-model (1-3B) viability.

**Rationale:** Code generation with verification requires 7-8B+ models. Focus on what can ship on 8GB RAM today.

**Status:** Infrastructure complete (3-layer verification, pattern learning, fast paths), but intent verification layer incomplete.

## Agent Delegation Notes

When working with the 12-agent orchestration system from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

### When to Invoke Agents for ReOS Work

**scout** - Use for finding where features live in the codebase. Example: "Where is calendar sync implemented?"

**planner** - Use for non-trivial features. Example: "Plan how to add recurring event expansion to CAIRN surfacing."

**implementer** - Use after plan approval. Knows Python 3.12+, ruff, mypy, pytest conventions from this file.

**tester** - Use for TDD workflow. Knows 45% coverage requirement, pytest conventions.

**reviewer** - Use after implementation. Checks for type hints, error handling, docstrings.

**state-fidelity** - Use after features that display backend state in Tauri UI. Example: After implementing new Play overlay features.

**documenter** - Use for substantial doc updates. Knows ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md structure.

**debugger** - Use for diagnosing issues. Add logging to atomic_ops pipeline, intent engine, or provider calls.

**verifier** - Use as final checkpoint before declaring work complete.

### This File's Role

This CLAUDE.md provides project context that agents need but shouldn't spend tokens discovering:
- Architecture patterns (atomic ops, The Play, intent engine)
- Code quality standards (Python 3.12+, ruff, mypy, 45% coverage)
- Recent design decisions (CAIRN simplification, Ollama-only, RIVA frozen)
- Key file locations by use case
- Commit conventions

## Common Patterns

### Adding a New CAIRN Tool

1. Define in `list_tools()` in `src/reos/mcp_tools.py`
2. Implement in `CairnToolHandler.call_tool()` in `src/reos/cairn/mcp_tools.py`
3. Add intent patterns to `INTENT_PATTERNS` in `intent_engine.py` (if natural language support needed)
4. Add to category mapping in `CATEGORY_TOOLS` in `intent_engine.py`
5. Write test in `tests/test_cairn_mcp_tools.py`

### Adding a New Atomic Operation Classification

Atomic ops use the 3x2x3 taxonomy. Most work involves tuning classification in `processor.py`, not adding new categories.

If genuinely new semantics needed:
1. Update `ExecutionSemantics` enum in `src/reos/types.py`
2. Update classification logic in `src/reos/atomic_ops/processor.py`
3. Update verification mode selection in `src/reos/atomic_ops/cairn_integration.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/test_atomic_ops.py`

### Adding a New RPC Handler

1. Create handler in `src/reos/rpc_handlers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseRPCHandler` (see `_base.py` for example)
3. Register in `src/reos/ui_rpc_server.py`
4. Add TypeScript types in `apps/reos-tauri/src/types.ts`
5. Call from frontend via `invoke("rpc_call", { method, params })`

## Summary

This is a local-first AI assistant focused on democratizing AI through small models (1-3B parameters) that run on accessible hardware (8GB RAM, no GPU). The architecture decomposes operations into atomic units, uses a 2-tier life organization system (Acts → Scenes), and prioritizes verification/safety because local inference is free.

**When in doubt:**
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md for system overview
2. Check this file for conventions and recent decisions
3. Follow the global workflow from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
4. Ask clarifying questions before implementing

**Mission:** Build the best AI assistant in the world. Then give it away.
