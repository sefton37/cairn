"""Signal Quality Check — Is the user engaging deliberately with approvals?

Reads user_feedback.time_to_decision_ms to detect patterns:
- Rapid-fire approvals (<1s) suggest rubber-stamping
- Very slow approvals (>30s) suggest confusion
- Healthy: mix of deliberate review times

Reframe Protocol: "Some approvals seem very quick — the system may not be
giving you enough time to review."
