"""LLM-based entity resolution for atomic operations.

When a user refers to entities (scenes, acts, beats), this module uses
LLM inference to resolve which entity they mean. No fuzzy matching or
regex - pure semantic understanding.

Core principle: If uncertain, return uncertainty. Let the atomic
verification pipeline handle disambiguation.
