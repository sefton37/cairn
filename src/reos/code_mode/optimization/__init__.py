"""RIVA Performance Optimization modules.

This package contains optimization strategies to improve RIVA's performance
while maintaining verification quality. The core philosophy:

    "ChatGPT optimizes for speed. RIVA optimizes for correctness."

We accept being 3x slower in exchange for more rigorous verification.
These optimizations reduce unnecessary overhead, not verification rigor.

Modules:
    metrics: Execution metrics collection and analysis
    complexity: Task complexity analysis for smart decomposition
    risk: Action risk classification for confidence-based verification
    trust: Session-level trust budget management
    pattern_success: Pattern success tracking for learned trust
    verification: Batch verification for reduced LLM calls
    fast_path: Optimized handlers for common patterns
    model_selector: Task-appropriate model selection

Usage:
    from reos.code_mode.optimization import (
        ExecutionMetrics,
        TaskComplexity,
        analyze_complexity,
        ActionRisk,
        assess_risk,
        TrustBudget,
    )

All optimizations are opt-in and can be enabled/disabled via config.
When in doubt, we fall back to full verification.
