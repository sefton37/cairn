"""UI RPC server for the ReOS desktop app.

This is a small JSON-RPC 2.0 server over stdio intended to be used by a
TypeScript desktop shell (Tauri).

Design goals:
- Local-only (stdio; no network listener).
- Metadata-first by default.
- Stable, explicit contract between UI and kernel.

This is intentionally *not* MCP; it's a UI-facing RPC layer. We still expose
`tools/list` + `tools/call` by delegating to the existing repo-scoped tool
catalog so the UI can reuse those capabilities.
