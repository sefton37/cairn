# Talking Rock - Your AI, Your Rules

**An AI assistant that lives on your computer, not in the cloud. Free forever. No subscriptions. No data harvesting. Just help when you need it.**

---

## For Everyone (Even If You've Never Used Linux Before)

### What Is This?

Talking Rock is like having a helpful friend who:
- **Organizes your life** - Keeps track of your projects, todos, and what needs attention
- **Manages your computer** - Helps you do things on your Linux computer through conversation
- **Helps you code** - If you're a developer, it can write and fix code with you

### Why Should You Care?

Every major AI assistant (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) runs on someone else's servers. That means:
- You pay monthly subscriptions forever
- Your private conversations go to their computers
- They can change the rules anytime
- If they shut down, you lose access

**Talking Rock is different:**
- **It runs on YOUR computer** - Your data stays with you
- **It's free** - No subscription, ever
- **You own it** - Open source, can't be taken away
- **It works offline** - No internet required for local models

### Is This For Me?

Talking Rock is for you if:
- You want an AI assistant that respects your privacy
- You're tired of subscription fatigue
- You want to learn Linux with a patient helper
- You're a developer who wants local AI coding assistance
- You believe software should work for users, not advertisers

### What Do I Need?

**The basics:**
- A computer running Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, etc.)
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended for better AI models)
- About 10GB of free disk space

**Never used Linux?** That's okay! Here's the simplest path:
1. Install [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) - it's designed for beginners
2. Follow our [Beginner's Setup Guide](docs/beginners-guide.md) (coming soon)

## How It Works

Talking Rock has three specialized helpers (we call them "agents"):

| Agent | What It Does | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **CAIRN** | Manages your attention and life | "What should I focus on today?" |
| **ReOS** | Controls your computer | "What's using all my memory?" |
| **RIVA** | Helps with coding | "Add login to my web app" |

You talk to CAIRN by default. It automatically routes to the right helper:
- Life question? CAIRN handles it
- Computer question? Routes to ReOS (with your permission)
- Code question? Routes to RIVA (with your permission)

### CAIRN - The Attention Minder

Your calm, non-judgmental life organizer. CAIRN helps you focus on what matters without making you feel guilty about what you haven't done yet.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Shows you the **next thing**, not everything
- **You decide priority** - CAIRN just helps you see when decisions are needed
- Integrates with your calendar (Thunderbird)
- **Never guilt-trips** - "Waiting when you're ready" instead of "You haven't touched this in 30 days!"

**What It Can Do:**
- Track projects, todos, and notes
- Surface what needs attention today
- Link people to projects (knows who's involved in what)
- Keep track of what you're waiting on
- Understand your identity and filter distractions (Coherence Kernel)

### ReOS - The System Helper

Talk to your Linux computer in plain English. ReOS understands your system deeply and explains what it's doing.

```
You: What's using all my memory?

ReOS: Here are the top memory users:
      1. Chrome (2.3 GB)
      2. Docker (1.8 GB)
      3. VS Code (890 MB)

You: Stop all my Docker containers

ReOS: I'll stop these containers:
      - nextcloud-app
      - nextcloud-redis
      - nextcloud-db

      Proceed? [y/n]: y
      Done! All containers stopped.
```

**What It Can Do:**
- Monitor processes and memory
- Manage services (systemd)
- Install and remove packages
- Control Docker containers
- Work with files
- Run shell commands (with safety checks)

**Shell Integration Philosophy:**

ReOS shell integration follows one core principle: **Never obstruct Linux**.

When you install a package and apt asks `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]`, you type Y. That's how Linux works. ReOS enhances your terminal with natural language - it never breaks the normal flow.

This means:
- Commands run with full terminal access (stdin/stdout/stderr connected)
- Interactive prompts work normally - you can always respond
- ReOS adds capability, never removes it
- Prefix with `!` to bypass ReOS entirely: `!apt install vim`

```bash
# Enable shell integration (add to ~/.bashrc)
source /path/to/ReOS/scripts/reos-shell-integration.sh

# Now just type naturally
$ install gimp
[ReOS understands and runs: sudo apt install gimp]
[apt prompts for Y/n - you type normally]
```

**Context-Aware Proposals (Parse Gate):**

ReOS checks your system before proposing commands - it knows what's installed:

```
$ run gimp                           # gimp IS installed
→ Proposal: gimp                     # Just run it

$ run gimp                           # gimp NOT installed
→ Proposal: sudo apt install gimp    # Offer to install

$ picture editor                     # Natural language
→ Found: GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
→ Proposal: gimp
```

How it works:
1. **Intent Analysis** - Detects verbs: run, install, start, stop, etc.
2. **System Check** - Queries PATH, packages, services
3. **Semantic Search** - Finds programs by description ("picture editor" → GIMP)
4. **Smart Proposal** - Context-aware command suggestion

See [Parse Gate Architecture](docs/parse-gate.md) for technical details.

### RIVA - The Code Helper

A methodical coding assistant that verifies what you want before acting, writes tests first, and actually runs code to verify it works.

```
You: Add user login to my API

RIVA: [Understanding your request...]
      - You want: Authentication for your API
      - I found: src/api/ with existing routes

      [Here's how I'll verify it works:]
      ✓ test_login_valid_credentials passes
      ✓ test_login_invalid_password passes
      ✓ test_logout_clears_session passes

      [My plan:]
      1. Create src/auth.py
      2. Add routes to src/api/routes.py
      3. Create tests/test_auth.py
      4. Run tests to verify

      [Showing what I'll change...]

      Approve? [y/n]
```

**What It Can Do:**
- Understand your project structure
- Write code with tests first
- Debug failures automatically
- Work with Git
- Support Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go

---

## Safety First

### You're Always in Control

- **Preview before changes** - See exactly what will change before any file is modified
- **Approval required** - All changes need your OK
- **Automatic backups** - Every modified file is backed up
- **Undo anything** - Rollback any change

### Built-in Limits

Talking Rock has safety limits that can be tuned but not disabled:

| Protection | Default | Tunable Range |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Max iterations per task | 10 | 3-50 |
| Max run time | 5 minutes | 1-30 minutes |
| Sudo commands per session | 10 | 1-20 |
| Auth attempts (rate limit) | 5/minute | N/A |
| Command max length | 8KB | 1-16KB |

### Your Privacy

- **Local by default** - With Ollama, everything stays on your machine
- **No tracking** - We don't know you exist
- **Open source** - Read every line of code
- **Your choice** - Use local AI or cloud APIs

---

## The Play - Your Personal Knowledge System

Everything in Talking Rock is organized around "The Play" - a hierarchical system for your life:

| Level | Timeframe | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **The Play** | Your whole life | Your identity, values, goals |
| **Acts** | Major life chapters | "Building my startup", "Learning music" |
| **Scenes** | Projects within acts | "Launch MVP", "Complete album" |
| **Beats** | Tasks within scenes | "Set up database", "Record vocals" |

CAIRN uses this structure to:
- Know what you're working on
- Surface the right things at the right time
- Understand context when you ask questions

---

## How Talking Rock Compares

| Feature | ChatGPT | Copilot | Talking Rock |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Works offline | No | No | **Yes** |
| Your data stays private | No | No | **Yes** |
| Free forever | No | No | **Yes** |
| Open source | No | No | **Yes** |
| Life organization | No | No | **Yes** |
| Linux system control | No | No | **Yes** |
| Code assistance | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |

### The Honest Tradeoff

> "ChatGPT optimizes for speed. RIVA optimizes for correctness."

| Dimension | Big Tech | Talking Rock |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Speed** | 5-15 seconds | 15-45 seconds |
| **Cost** | $20-500/month | Free |
| **First-try success** | 90-95% | 85-90% (but safer) |
| **Ownership** | Their cloud | Your machine |
| **Trust** | Optimized for speed | Optimized for verification |

**Why choose slower?** Because Talking Rock spends extra cycles verifying before acting. The tradeoff: slower responses, but more rigorous checking. You still approve all changes. All you need is patience.

## The Mission

> **Don't rent a data center. Center your data around you.**

Big tech companies want AI to be a subscription you pay forever. They collect your data, train on your conversations, and can change the rules anytime.

We believe AI should be:
- **Owned by you** - Not rented from a corporation
- **Private** - Your thoughts are your own
- **Transparent** - You can see exactly how it works
- **Free** - No subscription, no "we changed our pricing"

**Our goal: Build the best AI assistant in the world. Then give it away.**
